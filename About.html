            We recognised the need for research and database for the management of crime following the serious threat posed by crime.<br> Then we came up with an idea of setting up a project of Improving Boda Boda business and its challenges,crimes and threats with the overriding objective of carrying out research into the causes of crime and its prevention and to disseminate research findings to Government Agencies charged with administration of criminal justice with a view to assisting them in their policy formulation and planning.<br>The research has provided critical information on what works to impact on crime and disorder and has helped to generate programmes that can assist criminal justice agencies.<br>The program is providing practical cost effective solutions to crime that are geared towards improving peopleâ€™s lives.<br> 
            The program is looking upto to provide quality and authentic research into causes of crime and its prevention with a view to achieving a crime free society.
